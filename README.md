Define your objective: Clearly state what you want to achieve with the test, whether it's higher conversion rates, more clicks, or improved user engagement.

Identify your baseline (A): This is the current version of the webpage or content that you want to test against. It serves as the control group.

Create a variation (B): Make a single change to the baseline version to create the alternative variation. This is the treatment group.

Randomly assign users: Divide your audience into two groups, with one group exposed to version A and the other to version B. It's essential to ensure that the assignment is random to avoid bias.

Collect data: Monitor user interactions and behaviors to gather relevant data on both versions. This may include metrics like conversion rates, click-through rates, bounce rates, or revenue generated.

Analyze the results: Use statistical methods to determine which version (A or B) performed better based on the collected data. Common statistical tests include t-tests, chi-squared tests, or Bayesian analysis.

Draw conclusions: Based on the analysis, determine which version is the winner. If version B performs better, you may implement it as the new standard.

Continuous optimization: AB testing is an ongoing process. After implementing the winning version, continue to iterate and test new variations to continually improve your digital content or user experience.
